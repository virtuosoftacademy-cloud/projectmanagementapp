/**
 * The seed: one workspace — virtuosoft — its editable roles, and an admin to
 * sign in with. Nothing else.
 *
 * Applies by default, because this is what `npm run db:seed` and Prisma's own
 * seed hook call on deploy. Pass --dry-run to see the plan without writing:
 *
 *   npx tsx prisma/seed.ts                # create/refresh virtuosoft
 *   npx tsx prisma/seed.ts --dry-run      # show what it would do
 *
 * It touches no other workspace. Anything already in the database — including
 * older workspaces — is left exactly as it is.
 *
 * There is deliberately no demo data here: a seed that invents projects, tasks
 * and time entries is a liability the moment it runs anywhere real. A
 * workspace, its roles and a way in are the things that cannot be created from
 * inside the app.
 *
 * The role definitions live in `src/lib/default-roles.ts`, which is also what
 * workspace creation calls, so a seeded workspace and a newly created one can
 * never disagree. Idempotent and additive throughout: rows that already exist
 * are left untouched, so re-running never undoes an edit made in the app.
 *
 * No existing user is ever disturbed. The seed writes to `User` exactly once —
 * creating the admin when no account holds that email — and never updates one:
 * not the name, not the password, not the workspace it resumes into. If the
 * address is already taken it takes no further action on that account, not even
 * adding it to the workspace, because joining a real person's account would
 * change what they can reach. Grant that access from Admin → Users instead.
