 * The weekly grid across every project the viewer is on, filterable to one.
 *
 * Entries are limited to the viewer's own projects for the same reason the
 * project lists are — someone should not see hours logged on work they were
 * never added to. `projectScope()` widens that to the whole workspace for
 * owners and admins, so the filter offers them everything they are responsible
 * for.
 *
 * The rows are aggregated in the client component rather than here: the filter
 * is a view of data already sent, so changing project should not cost a round
 * trip.
